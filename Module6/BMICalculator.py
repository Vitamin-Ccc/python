# Write a program that calculates an adult's fat-burning heart rate and BMI. The fat-burning heart rate is calculated by subtracting the person's age from 220. The result of this is the maximum heart rate and for fat burning 70% of the maximum would be needed. For example if the age entered is 40 then the maximum heart rate is 180 and 70% of this 126 bpm. This would be the persons fat burning heart rate.

# Body mass index is a measure of whether someoneâ€™s weight is appropriate for their height. A body-mass-index value between 19 and 25 is considered to be in the normal range.

# Perform input validation using exception handling by making sure the user enters only numbers (no strings!) and that those numbers are positive.
